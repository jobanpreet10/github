# Count Servers that Communicate

## Problem Description
You are given a map of a server center, represented as an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, where:
- `1` means that on that cell there is a server.
- `0` means that it is no server.

Two servers are said to communicate if they are on the same row or the same column.

The task is to return the number of servers that can communicate with any other server.

### Constraints:
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 250`
- `grid[i][j] == 0` or `1`

---

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```cpp
grid = [[1,0],
        [0,1]]
```
**Output:**
```
0
```
**Explanation:**
No servers can communicate with others.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```cpp
grid = [[1,0],
        [1,1]]
```
**Output:**
```
3
```
**Explanation:**
All three servers can communicate with at least one other server.

### Example 3:
**Input:**
```cpp
grid = [[1,1,0,0],
        [0,0,1,0],
        [0,0,1,0],
        [0,0,0,1]]
```
**Output:**
```
4
```
**Explanation:**
- The two servers in the first row can communicate with each other.
- The two servers in the third column can communicate with each other.
- The server at the bottom-right corner cannot communicate with any other server.

## Approach

### Algorithm:
1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Use two vectors, `indexRowCount` and `indexColCount`, to store the number of servers in each row and column, respectively.
   - Traverse the grid and update these counts for each cell containing a server (`grid[i][j] == 1`).

2. **Counting Communicating Servers:**
   - Traverse the grid again and for each cell containing a server (`grid[i][j] == 1`), check if the corresponding row or column has more than one server:
     - If `indexRowCount[i] > 1` or `indexColCount[j] > 1`, increment the result.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:**
  - `O(m * n)` for preprocessing the row and column counts.
  - `O(m * n)` for counting the communicating servers.
  - Total: `O(m * n)`.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - `O(m + n)` for the row and column count vectors.

## Code Implementation
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countServers(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        int result = 0;

        vector<int> indexColCount(n, 0);  // Count of servers in each column
        vector<int> indexRowCount(m, 0); // Count of servers in each row

        // Preprocess the grid to count servers in each row and column
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    indexColCount[j] += 1;
                    indexRowCount[i] += 1;
                }
            }
        }

        // Iterate through the grid again to find communicating servers
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1 && (indexRowCount[i] > 1 || indexColCount[j] > 1)) {
                    result++;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

## Explanation of Code:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `indexColCount` and `indexRowCount` vectors are initialized with `0` values.
   - `result` variable stores the count of communicating servers.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The grid is traversed to populate `indexColCount` and `indexRowCount` based on the presence of servers (`1`s).

3. **Counting Communicating Servers:**
   - The grid is traversed again, and for each server cell, it checks if the row or column contains more than one server. If yes, it increments the result.

---

## Edge Cases:
1. **All Zeros:**
   - Input: `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`
   - Output: `0`
   - No servers are present, so the result is `0`.

2. **Single Server:**
   - Input: `[[1]]`
   - Output: `0`
   - A single server cannot communicate with any other server.

3. **Large Grid with All Servers:**
   - Input: A grid where every cell is `1` (e.g., `10x10` grid with all servers).
   - Output: All servers can communicate with others.
