# 1400. Construct K Palindrome Strings

## Problem Description

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, determine whether it is possible to construct exactly `k` palindrome strings using all the characters in `s`. You must use all the characters from the string `s` and cannot discard any characters.

A string is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.

### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= k <= s.length`

---

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`s = "annabelle"`, `k = 2`

**Output:**  
`true`

**Explanation:**  
You can construct two palindromes using all characters in `s`. Possible constructions include:

- "anna" + "elble"
- "anbna" + "elle"
- "anellena" + "b"

### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`s = "leetcode"`, `k = 3`

**Output:**  
`false`

**Explanation:**  
It is impossible to construct 3 palindromes using all the characters of `s`.

### Example 3:

**Input:**  
`s = "true"`, `k = 4`

**Output:**  
`true`

**Explanation:**  
Each character in `s` can be used as a separate palindrome. Possible constructions are:

- "t", "r", "u", "e".

---

## Approach

1. **Edge Cases:**

   - If `k > s.length`, return `false` because it is impossible to create more palindromes than the number of characters available.
   - If `k == s.length`, return `true` because each character can form a palindrome on its own.

2. **Frequency Count:**

   - Count the frequency of each character in the string `s`.

3. **Odd Frequency Check:**

   - A character with an odd frequency requires one center position in a palindrome. Count the total number of characters with odd frequencies (`oddCount`).

4. **Feasibility Check:**
   - If `oddCount > k`, return `false` because we cannot distribute all odd characters into `k` palindromes.
   - Otherwise, return `true`.

---

## Algorithm

1. Calculate the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
2. Count the number of characters with odd frequencies.
3. Check if the number of odd frequency characters is greater than `k`.
   - If `oddCount > k`, return `false`.
   - Else, return `true`.

---

## Implementation

### C++ Code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canConstruct(string s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();

        // If k is greater than the length of the string, return false
        if (k > n) return false;

        // Frequency array to count occurrences of each character
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        for (char ch : s) {
            freq[ch - 'a']++;
        }

        // Count the number of characters with odd frequencies
        int oddCount = 0;
        for (int count : freq) {
            if (count % 2 != 0) oddCount++;
        }

        // Check feasibility
        return oddCount <= k;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

- **O(n):** Iterate through the string to calculate character frequencies.
- **O(1):** Traverse the frequency array (constant size 26).
- **Total:** O(n)

### Space Complexity:

- **O(1):** Fixed-size frequency array of 26.

## Key Insights

- The key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between odd-frequency characters and the structure of palindromes.
- Odd-frequency characters can only appear as the center of a palindrome, so the number of palindromes must be at least as large as the number of odd-frequency characters.
