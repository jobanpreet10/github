# Problem: Counting Words With a Given Prefix

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `pref`.

Return the number of strings in `words` that contain `pref` as a prefix.

A prefix of a string `s` is any leading contiguous substring of `s`.

### Examples

#### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
words = ["pay","attention","practice","attend"], pref = "at"
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
2
```

**Explanation:**
The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: "attention" and "attend".

#### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
words = ["leetcode","win","loops","success"], pref = "code"
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
0
```

**Explanation:**
There are no strings that contain "code" as a prefix.

---

### Constraints

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length, pref.length <= 100`
- `words[i]` and `pref` consist of lowercase English letters.

---

## Solution

### Approach

1. Iterate through each word in the `words` array.
2. Check if the given prefix `pref` exists at the start of the current word.
   - Use the `find` function to determine if the prefix starts at index `0`.
3. If the condition is satisfied, increment the count.
4. Return the count.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(N \* M), where:
  - `N` is the number of words in the array.
  - `M` is the average length of the words.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as no extra space is used apart from variables.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int prefixCount(vector<string>& words, string pref) {
        int n = pref.length();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
            if (words[i].find(pref) == 0) {
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Example Walkthrough

### Example Input:

```plaintext
words = ["pay", "attention", "practice", "attend"], pref = "at"
```

### Steps:

1. Initialize `ans = 0`.
2. Check each word in the `words` array:
   - "pay": does not start with "at".
   - "attention": starts with "at". Increment `ans` to 1.
   - "practice": does not start with "at".
   - "attend": starts with "at". Increment `ans` to 2.
3. Return `ans = 2`.

### Output:

```plaintext
2
```
