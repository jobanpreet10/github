# Grid Game

## Problem Description
You are given a 0-indexed 2D array `grid` of size 2 x n, where `grid[r][c]` represents the number of points at position `(r, c)` on the matrix. Two robots are playing a game on this matrix.

- Both robots start at `(0, 0)` and want to reach `(1, n-1)`.
- Each robot can only move **right** (`(r, c)` to `(r, c + 1)`) or **down** (`(r, c)` to `(r + 1, c)`).
- The first robot moves first and collects points along its path. All cells visited by the first robot are set to 0.
- The second robot then moves and collects points along its path, which may intersect with the first robot's path.

The first robot aims to minimize the points collected by the second robot, while the second robot aims to maximize its points.

Return the maximum number of points the second robot can collect if both robots play optimally.

### Example 1

#### Input
```plaintext
grid = [[2,5,4],[1,5,1]]
```

#### Output
```plaintext
4
```

#### Explanation
- First robot's optimal path: `(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (1, 2)`.
- The grid becomes: `[[0, 0, 0], [1, 5, 0]]`.
- Second robot's optimal path: `(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2)`.
- Points collected by the second robot: `0 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 4`.

### Example 2

#### Input
```plaintext
grid = [[3,3,1],[8,5,2]]
```

#### Output
```plaintext
4
```

#### Explanation
- First robot's optimal path: `(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (1, 2)`.
- The grid becomes: `[[0, 0, 0], [8, 5, 0]]`.
- Second robot's optimal path: `(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2)`.
- Points collected by the second robot: `0 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 4`.

### Example 3

#### Input
```plaintext
grid = [[1,3,1,15],[1,3,3,1]]
```

#### Output
```plaintext
7
```

#### Explanation
- First robot's optimal path: `(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (1, 3)`.
- The grid becomes: `[[0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 3, 3, 0]]`.
- Second robot's optimal path: `(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3)`.
- Points collected by the second robot: `0 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 7`.

## Constraints
- `grid.length == 2`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= grid[r][c] <= 10^5`

## Solution Explanation
The key idea is to calculate the maximum points the second robot can collect optimally by leveraging prefix sums for efficient computation.

### Algorithm
1. Compute the total sum of points in the first row (`row1RemainingSum`).
2. Initialize `row2RemainingSum` to `0`.
3. Iterate over each column:
   - Subtract the current column's value from `row1RemainingSum` (mimicking the first robot's traversal).
   - Calculate the maximum possible points for the second robot (`bestRobot2`) as the maximum of `row1RemainingSum` and `row2RemainingSum`.
   - Update the result to minimize the points collected by the second robot.
   - Add the current column's value from the second row to `row2RemainingSum` (mimicking the second robot's traversal).
4. Return the minimized result.

### Code Implementation
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long gridGame(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid[0].size();
        long long row1RemainigSum = accumulate(begin(grid[0]), end(grid[0]), 0LL);
        long long row2RemainigSum = 0;

        long long minimizedRobot2 = LONG_LONG_MAX;

        for (int Robot1col = 0; Robot1col < n; Robot1col++) {
            row1RemainigSum -= grid[0][Robot1col];

            long long bestRobot2 = max(row1RemainigSum, row2RemainigSum);

            minimizedRobot2 = min(minimizedRobot2, bestRobot2);

            row2RemainigSum += grid[1][Robot1col];
        }
        return minimizedRobot2;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of columns. Each column is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as no additional space is used apart from variables.
