# Word Subsets

## Problem Description

You are given two string arrays `words1` and `words2`.

A string `b` is a subset of string `a` if every letter in `b` occurs in `a` including multiplicity.

For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but is not a subset of "world".

A string `a` from `words1` is universal if for every string `b` in `words2`, `b` is a subset of `a`.

Return an array of all the universal strings in `words1`. You may return the answer in any order.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```text
words1 = ["amazon", "apple", "facebook", "google", "leetcode"]
words2 = ["e", "o"]
```

**Output:**

```text
["facebook", "google", "leetcode"]
```

### Example 2

**Input:**

```text
words1 = ["amazon", "apple", "facebook", "google", "leetcode"]
words2 = ["l", "e"]
```

**Output:**

```text
["apple", "google", "leetcode"]
```

## Solution Explanation

### Key Idea

1. Create a frequency array `freq2` to store the maximum count of each character across all strings in `words2`.
2. For each string in `words1`, check if it satisfies the character frequency requirements defined by `freq2`. If it does, add it to the result.

### Implementation Details

1. Iterate through each string in `words2` and calculate its character frequency. Update `freq2` to keep the maximum frequency for each character.
2. For each string in `words1`, calculate its character frequency. Check if this frequency satisfies `freq2` using the `isSubset` function.
3. If it satisfies, add the string to the result array.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:

    bool isSubset(vector<int>&temp, vector<int>freq2) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (temp[i] < freq2[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    vector<string> wordSubsets(vector<string>& words1, vector<string>& words2) {
        vector<string> result;
        vector<int> freq2(26, 0);

        for (string &word : words2) {
            int temp[26] = {0};
            for (char ch : word) {
                temp[ch - 'a']++;
                freq2[ch - 'a'] = max(freq2[ch - 'a'], temp[ch - 'a']);
            }
        }

        for (string &word : words1) {
            vector<int> temp(26, 0);
            for (char ch : word) {
                temp[ch - 'a']++;
            }
            if (isSubset(temp, freq2)) {
                result.push_back(word);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

1. **Frequency Calculation for `words2`**:

   - Each word is processed to update the frequency array `freq2`. If the total number of characters in `words2` is `m`, this step takes **O(m)**.

2. **Frequency Check for `words1`**:
   - Each word is processed to check if it satisfies the subset condition. If the total number of characters in `words1` is `n`, this step takes **O(n)**.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(m + n)**.

### Space Complexity

- The space used for the `freq2` and temporary frequency arrays is **O(26)** (constant space for alphabet characters).
- Additional space for storing the result is proportional to the number of universal strings.

## How to Run

1. Copy the code into a C++ file (e.g., `WordSubsets.cpp`).
2. Compile and run the program.
3. Provide the input arrays `words1` and `words2` as test cases.
4. The output will be a list of universal strings from `words1`.

---

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty `words2`:**

   - All strings in `words1` are universal since there are no constraints.

2. **Empty `words1`:**

   - The result is an empty array since there are no strings to check.

3. **Strings with Non-Alphabet Characters:**
   - Ensure that input contains only lowercase English letters for the algorithm to work correctly.
