# Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid

## Problem Description

Given an `m x n` grid, each cell in the grid contains a sign that points to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in that cell. The directions are encoded as follows:

- `1`: Move to the right (from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i][j + 1]`)
- `2`: Move to the left (from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i][j - 1]`)
- `3`: Move downward (from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i + 1][j]`)
- `4`: Move upward (from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i - 1][j]`)

You start at the upper-left cell `(0, 0)` and need to reach the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)` by following the signs on the grid. A valid path must start at `(0, 0)` and end at `(m - 1, n - 1)`.

To modify a sign in a cell, you incur a cost of `1`. You can modify a sign only once. The goal is to determine the **minimum cost** required to make at least one valid path from `(0, 0)` to `(m - 1, n - 1)`.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
grid = [[1, 1, 1, 1],
        [2, 2, 2, 2],
        [1, 1, 1, 1],
        [2, 2, 2, 2]]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
3
```

**Explanation:**

- Start at `(0, 0)`.
- Follow the path `(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 3)`.
- Modify the arrow at `(0, 3)` to point downward with cost = `1`.
- Path continues `(1, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0)`.
- Modify the arrow at `(1, 0)` to point downward with cost = `1`.
- Path continues `(2, 0) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3)`.
- Modify the arrow at `(2, 3)` to point downward with cost = `1`.
- Finally, reach `(3, 3)`.
- **Total cost = 3.**

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
grid = [[1, 1, 3],
        [3, 2, 2],
        [1, 1, 4]]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
0
```

**Explanation:**

- The grid already has a valid path starting from `(0, 0)` to `(2, 2)`. No modifications are required.

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```plaintext
grid = [[1, 2],
        [4, 3]]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
1
```

## Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 4`

## Approach

The problem is solved using **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to compute the minimum cost to reach the bottom-right cell.

### Algorithm:

1. **Initialization:**

   - Create a `result` matrix initialized to `INT_MAX` to store the minimum cost for each cell.
   - Use a priority queue (`min-heap`) to process cells in increasing order of cost.

2. **Traversal:**

   - Start from `(0, 0)` with cost `0` and push it into the priority queue.
   - Use a `directions` array to define the possible moves (right, left, down, up).

3. **Processing Each Cell:**

   - Pop the cell with the lowest cost from the priority queue.
   - Skip processing if the current cost is greater than the cost stored in `result`.
   - For each direction:
     - Compute the next cell coordinates.
     - Calculate the cost to move to the next cell. If it aligns with the grid's arrow direction, the cost is `0`; otherwise, the cost is `1`.
     - If the new cost is lower than the current cost stored in `result`, update `result` and push the new cell into the priority queue.

4. **Result:**
   - Return the value in `result[m - 1][n - 1]`, which contains the minimum cost to reach the bottom-right corner.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> result(m, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));

        priority_queue<vector<int>, vector<vector<int>>, greater<>> pq;

        // Directions: right, left, down, up
        vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};

        pq.push({0, 0, 0}); // {cost, row, col}
        result[0][0] = 0;

        while (!pq.empty()) {
            auto curr = pq.top();
            pq.pop();

            int currCost = curr[0];
            int i = curr[1];
            int j = curr[2];

            // Skip if we've already processed this with a lower cost
            if (currCost > result[i][j]) continue;

            for (int dir_i = 0; dir_i < 4; dir_i++) {
                int i_new = i + directions[dir_i].first;
                int j_new = j + directions[dir_i].second;

                if (i_new >= 0 && i_new < m && j_new >= 0 && j_new < n) {
                    int gridDir = grid[i][j];
                    int dirCost = (gridDir - 1 == dir_i) ? 0 : 1;

                    int newCost = currCost + dirCost;

                    if (newCost < result[i_new][j_new]) {
                        result[i_new][j_new] = newCost;
                        pq.push({newCost, i_new, j_new});
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return result[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:

- **Grid Traversal:** Each cell is processed at most once.
- **Priority Queue Operations:** For a grid of size `m x n`, the queue can hold up to `m * n` elements.
- Total complexity: **O(m _ n _ log(m \* n))**.

### Space Complexity:

- **Result Matrix:** O(m \* n).
- **Priority Queue:** O(m \* n).
- Total complexity: **O(m \* n)**.
