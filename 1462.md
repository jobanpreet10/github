# Course Schedule IV

## Problem Description

You are given `numCourses` labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. Each course may have prerequisites given in the form of pairs, where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `ai` before taking course `bi`.

You are also given `queries`, where each query asks whether one course is a prerequisite of another. For each query `queries[j] = [uj, vj]`, determine whether course `uj` is a prerequisite of course `vj`.

### Key Points:
- Prerequisites can be **indirect**, meaning if `a` is a prerequisite of `b`, and `b` is a prerequisite of `c`, then `a` is also a prerequisite of `c`.
- The graph is guaranteed to be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

## Example Input/Output

### Example 1
**Input:**
```plaintext
numCourses = 2
prerequisites = [[1,0]]
queries = [[0,1],[1,0]]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
[false, true]
```
**Explanation:**
- The pair `[1, 0]` indicates that course `1` is a prerequisite of course `0`.
- Course `0` is not a prerequisite of course `1`.

### Example 2
**Input:**
```plaintext
numCourses = 2
prerequisites = []
queries = [[1,0],[0,1]]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
[false, false]
```
**Explanation:**
- There are no prerequisites; each course is independent.

### Example 3
**Input:**
```plaintext
numCourses = 3
prerequisites = [[1,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
queries = [[1,0],[1,2]]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
[true, true]
```
**Explanation:**
- Course `1` is a prerequisite of both courses `0` and `2`.

## Constraints
- `2 <= numCourses <= 100`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= (numCourses * (numCourses - 1) / 2)`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi <= numCourses - 1`
- `ai != bi`
- All prerequisite pairs `[ai, bi]` are unique.
- The prerequisites graph has no cycles.
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= ui, vi <= numCourses - 1`
- `ui != vi`

## Solution Approach

### Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to compute the **transitive closure** of the graph. This allows us to determine whether any course is reachable from another. Here are the steps:

1. **Initialize a Reachability Matrix:**
   - Create a `numCourses x numCourses` matrix `reachable`, where `reachable[i][j] = true` means course `j` is reachable from course `i`.

2. **Fill Direct Prerequisites:**
   - For each pair `[u, v]` in `prerequisites`, set `reachable[u][v] = true`.

3. **Compute Transitive Closure:**
   - Use Floyd-Warshall to check if course `k` acts as a bridge between course `i` and course `j`:
     ```cpp
     if (reachable[i][k] && reachable[k][j]) {
         reachable[i][j] = true;
     }
     ```

4. **Answer Queries Efficiently:**
   - For each query `[uj, vj]`, simply return `reachable[uj][vj]`.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<bool> checkIfPrerequisite(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        // Initialize the reachability matrix
        vector<vector<bool>> reachable(numCourses, vector<bool>(numCourses, false));

        // Fill the matrix for direct prerequisites
        for (auto& edge : prerequisites) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            reachable[u][v] = true;
        }

        // Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute transitive closure
        for (int k = 0; k < numCourses; ++k) {
            for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
                for (int j = 0; j < numCourses; ++j) {
                    if (reachable[i][k] && reachable[k][j]) {
                        reachable[i][j] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Answer the queries
        vector<bool> ans;
        for (auto& query : queries) {
            int preq = query[0];
            int course = query[1];
            ans.push_back(reachable[preq][course]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
1. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:**
   - The three nested loops run `O(numCourses^3)`.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - Answering each query takes `O(1)`, and there are `O(queries.size())` queries.

   **Total:**
   ```
   O(numCourses^3 + queries.size())
   ```

### Space Complexity
- The `reachable` matrix takes `O(numCourses^2)` space.

## Advantages of the Approach
1. Precomputing the reachability matrix ensures each query is answered in constant time.
2. Handles both direct and indirect prerequisites efficiently.

## Limitations
- The approach may be slow for large `numCourses` due to the `O(numCourses^3)` complexity.
- For sparse graphs, a DFS-based approach may be more efficient.

## Alternatives
1. **DFS with Memoization:**
   - Perform a DFS for each query to check reachability, and cache results to avoid redundant computation.

2. **Topological Sort:**
   - Use a topological sort to order the courses and then determine reachability.
