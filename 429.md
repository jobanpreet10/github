# Trapping Rain Water II

## Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` integer matrix `heightMap` representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, return the volume of water it can trap after raining.

### Examples

#### Example 1

```plaintext
Input: heightMap = [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks.
We have two small ponds 1 and 3 units trapped. The total volume of water trapped is 4.
```

#### Example 2

```plaintext
Input: heightMap = [[3,3,3,3,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,2,1,2,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,3,3,3,3]]
Output: 10
```

### Constraints

- `m == heightMap.length`
- `n == heightMap[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `0 <= heightMap[i][j] <= 2 * 10^4`

## Approach

To solve this problem, we use a **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)** approach, which processes the boundary cells first and progressively moves inward, ensuring that the water level calculation is accurate for each cell.

### Algorithm

1. **Initialize Priority Queue**:

   - Use a priority queue to keep track of boundary cells. Each element in the queue is a tuple `(height, (row, col))`.
   - Add all boundary cells of the matrix to the queue and mark them as visited.

2. **Process Boundary Cells**:

   - While the priority queue is not empty, pop the smallest height cell.
   - Check all its neighbors. If a neighbor is unvisited, calculate the water trapped as:
     ```
     water += max(0, height - heightMap[new_row][new_col])
     ```
   - Push the neighbor into the priority queue with the effective height:
     ```
     max(height, heightMap[new_row][new_col])
     ```
   - Mark the neighbor as visited.

3. **Return the Total Water**:
   - After processing all cells, the total trapped water is stored in the variable `water`.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n * log(m * n))`
  - Each cell is pushed and popped from the priority queue once, and each operation takes `O(log(m * n))`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n)`
  - Space is used for the priority queue and the `visited` array.

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    typedef pair<int, pair<int, int>> PP;
    vector<vector<int>> directions = {{0, -1}, {0, 1}, {-1, 0}, {1, 0}};

    int trapRainWater(vector<vector<int>>& heightMap) {
        int m = heightMap.size();
        if (m == 0) return 0;  // No cells
        int n = heightMap[0].size();

        priority_queue<PP, vector<PP>, greater<>> boundaryCells;
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));

        // Add all boundary cells to the priority queue
        for (int row = 0; row < m; row++) {
            for (int col : {0, n - 1}) {
                boundaryCells.push({heightMap[row][col], {row, col}});
                visited[row][col] = true;
            }
        }

        for (int col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            for (int row : {0, m - 1}) {
                boundaryCells.push({heightMap[row][col], {row, col}});
                visited[row][col] = true;
            }
        }

        int water = 0;

        // Process cells
        while (!boundaryCells.empty()) {
            PP p = boundaryCells.top();
            boundaryCells.pop();
            int height = p.first;
            int i = p.second.first;
            int j = p.second.second;

            for (vector<int>& dir : directions) {
                int new_i = i + dir[0];
                int new_j = j + dir[1];

                // Check for valid neighbor cells
                if (new_i >= 0 && new_i < m && new_j >= 0 && new_j < n && !visited[new_i][new_j]) {
                    // Calculate trapped water
                    water += max(0, height - heightMap[new_i][new_j]);

                    // Update priority queue with the effective height
                    boundaryCells.push({max(height, heightMap[new_i][new_j]), {new_i, new_j}});
                    visited[new_i][new_j] = true;
                }
            }
        }

        return water;
    }
};
```

## Example Execution

### Input

```plaintext
heightMap = [[1,4,3,1,3,2], [3,2,1,3,2,4], [2,3,3,2,3,1]]
```

### Output

```plaintext
4
```

The algorithm identifies the two regions of trapped water (1 and 3 units) and returns the total volume of 4.
