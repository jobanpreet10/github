# Maximum Employees to Be Invited to a Meeting

## Problem Description
A company is organizing a meeting and has a list of employees. Each employee has a favorite person, and they will attend the meeting only if they can sit next to their favorite person at the table. The objective is to find the **maximum number of employees** that can be invited to the meeting while satisfying their conditions.

### Input
- A 0-indexed integer array `favorite`, where `favorite[i]` denotes the favorite person of the `i`-th employee.
- Constraints:
  - \( n == favorite.length \)
  - \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
  - \( 0 \leq favorite[i] \leq n - 1 \)
  - \( favorite[i] \neq i \)

### Output
- An integer representing the maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting.

## Solution Explanation
This solution approaches the problem using a combination of graph traversal and cycle detection.

### Key Observations
1. The employees and their favorite persons form a **directed graph**.
   - Each employee is a node.
   - There is a directed edge from node `i` to `favorite[i]`.

2. The problem can be divided into two scenarios:
   - **Cycle Detection**: Find the longest cycle in the graph, as employees in the cycle can all sit together.
   - **"Happy Couples"**: Cycles of length 2 (mutual favorites) can have additional employees sitting on either side of the "happy couple".

### Solution Steps
1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Reverse the graph to simplify traversal when calculating path lengths to a node.

2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - Use a hash map to track visited nodes and detect cycles.
   - Compute the cycle length for each cycle and track the longest cycle.

3. **Happy Couple Expansion**:
   - For cycles of length 2, calculate the maximum number of additional employees who can join using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

4. **Final Result**:
   - Return the maximum of the longest cycle or the total number of employees involved in the "happy couple" scenario.

## Code Implementation
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
      int BFS(int start, unordered_map<int, vector<int>>& adj, vector<bool>& visited) {
        queue<pair<int, int>> que; // {node, path length}
        que.push({start, 0});
        int maxDistance = 0;

        while(!que.empty()) {
            auto[currNode, dist] = que.front();
            que.pop();

            for(auto &ngbr : adj[currNode]) {
                if(!visited[ngbr]) {
                    visited[ngbr] = true;
                    que.push({ngbr, dist+1});
                    maxDistance = max(maxDistance, dist+1);
                }
            }
        }

        return maxDistance;
    }

    int maximumInvitations(vector<int>& favorite) {
        int n = favorite.size();
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> adj;

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int u = i;
            int v = favorite[i];
            // u --> v
            adj[v].push_back(u); // reversed graph - so that we can find the path length after traversal
        }

        int longestCycleEmplCount = 0;
        int happyCoupleEmplCount  = 0; // cycle length = 2 waalo se kitna milpaega total

        vector<bool> visited(n, false);

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            if(!visited[i]) {
                // {node, abtak ka node count}
                unordered_map<int, int> mp;

                int currNode      = i;
                int currNodeCount = 0;

                while(!visited[currNode]) { // until cycle is not detected
                    visited[currNode] = true;
                    mp[currNode] = currNodeCount;

                    int nextNode = favorite[currNode]; // favorite node of curr node
                    currNodeCount += 1;

                    if(mp.count(nextNode)) { // already visited hai ye. Matlab cycle detect hogaya hai
                        int cycleLength = currNodeCount - mp[nextNode];
                        longestCycleEmplCount = max(longestCycleEmplCount, cycleLength);

                        if(cycleLength == 2) { // happy couple case
                            // currNode <-> nextNode = 2 nodes
                            vector<bool> visitedNodes(n, false);
                            visitedNodes[currNode] = true;
                            visitedNodes[nextNode] = true;
                            happyCoupleEmplCount += 2 + BFS(currNode, adj, visitedNodes) + BFS(nextNode, adj, visitedNodes);
                        }
                        break;
                    }
                    currNode = nextNode;
                }
            }
        }

        return max(happyCoupleEmplCount, longestCycleEmplCount);
    }
};
```

## Example Walkthrough

### Example 1
Input:
```cpp
favorite = [2, 2, 1, 2]
```

Output:
```cpp
3
```

Explanation:
- The company can invite employees 0, 1, and 2 and seat them at the table.

### Example 2
Input:
```cpp
favorite = [1, 2, 0]
```

Output:
```cpp

```

Explanation:
- All employees form a single cycle, so all can be invited.

### Example 3
Input:
```cpp
favorite = [3, 0, 1, 4, 1]
```

```cpp
4
```

Explanation:
- Employees 0, 1, 3, and 4 can be seated.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- Graph traversal: \( O(n) \).
- BFS for path lengths: \( O(n) \).
- Overall: \( O(n) \).

### Space Complexity
- Adjacency list: \( O(n) \).
- Visited array and auxiliary data structures: \( O(n) \).
- Overall: \( O(n) \).

## Conclusion
This solution effectively handles cycles and expansions for "happy couples" to compute the maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting. The use of graph traversal ensures efficiency, even for the upper constraint of \( n \leq 10^5 \).
