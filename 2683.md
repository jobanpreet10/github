# Neighboring Bitwise XOR

This repository contains the solution to the problem **2683. Neighboring Bitwise XOR**, which determines whether a valid binary array `original` exists that could produce the given `derived` array by performing a specific bitwise XOR operation.

---

## Problem Description

### Definition

A 0-indexed array `derived` of length `n` is derived from a binary array `original` of length `n` by computing the bitwise XOR (`⊕`) of adjacent values in `original`:

- If `i = n - 1`, then `derived[i] = original[i] ⊕ original[0]`.
- Otherwise, `derived[i] = original[i] ⊕ original[i + 1]`.

Given the array `derived`, the task is to determine whether there exists a valid binary array `original` that could have formed `derived`.

### Constraints

- `n == derived.length`
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`
- The values in `derived` are either `0` or `1`.

---

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```plaintext
[1, 1, 0]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
true
```

**Explanation:**
A valid `original` array that gives `derived` is `[0, 1, 0]`.

- `derived[0] = original[0] ⊕ original[1] = 0 ⊕ 1 = 1`
- `derived[1] = original[1] ⊕ original[2] = 1 ⊕ 0 = 1`
- `derived[2] = original[2] ⊕ original[0] = 0 ⊕ 0 = 0`

### Example 2

**Input:**

```plaintext
[1, 1]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
true
```

**Explanation:**
A valid `original` array that gives `derived` is `[0, 1]`.

### Example 3

**Input:**

```plaintext
[1, 0]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
false
```

**Explanation:**
No valid `original` array exists for this `derived`.

## Approach

### Key Insight

The key observation is that the XOR of all elements in `derived` determines whether the cycle of XOR operations can lead back to a consistent starting value. Specifically:

- If the XOR of all elements in `derived` is `0`, then a valid `original` array exists.
- If the XOR is non-zero, then no such array exists.

### Algorithm

1. Compute the XOR of all elements in `derived`.
2. If the XOR is `0`, return `true`.
3. Otherwise, return `false`.

---

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool doesValidArrayExist(vector<int>& derived) {
        int Xor = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < derived.size(); i++) {
            Xor ^= derived[i];
        }

        return Xor == 0;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: We iterate through the `derived` array once to compute the XOR of all elements.

### Space Complexity

- **O(1)**: The solution uses a constant amount of extra space.

---

## Usage

1. Include the solution in your codebase.
2. Call `doesValidArrayExist()` with the given `derived` array.

### Example:

```cpp
vector<int> derived = {1, 1, 0};
Solution solution;
bool result = solution.doesValidArrayExist(derived);
cout << (result ? "true" : "false") << endl;
```
