# Minimize XOR

## Problem Description

You are given two positive integers `num1` and `num2`. The task is to find the positive integer `x` such that:

1. `x` has the same number of set bits (1's in its binary representation) as `num2`, and
2. The value of `x XOR num1` is minimal.

Return the integer `x`. The test cases are guaranteed such that `x` is uniquely determined.

### Example 1

**Input:**

```plaintext
num1 = 3, num2 = 5
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
3
```

**Explanation:**

- The binary representations of `num1` and `num2` are `0011` and `0101`, respectively.
- The integer `3` has the same number of set bits as `num2`, and the value `3 XOR 3 = 0` is minimal.

### Example 2

**Input:**

```plaintext
num1 = 1, num2 = 12
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
3
```

**Explanation:**

- The binary representations of `num1` and `num2` are `0001` and `1100`, respectively.
- The integer `3` has the same number of set bits as `num2`, and the value `3 XOR 1 = 2` is minimal.

## Implementation

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSet(int &x, int bit) {
        return x & (1 << bit);
    }

    bool setBit(int &x, int bit) {
        return x |= (1 << bit);
    }

    bool unSetBit(int &x, int bit) {
        return x &= ~(1 << bit);
    }

    bool isUnSet(int &x, int bit) {
        return (x & (1 << bit)) == 0;
    }

    int minimizeXor(int num1, int num2) {
        int x = 0;
        int reqSetBitCount = __builtin_popcount(num2);

        // Step 1: Set bits in `x` using set bits in `num1` from MSB to LSB
        for (int bit = 31; bit >= 0 && reqSetBitCount > 0; bit--) {
            if (isSet(num1, bit)) {
                setBit(x, bit);
                reqSetBitCount--;
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Set remaining unset bits in `x` starting from LSB
        for (int bit = 0; bit < 32 && reqSetBitCount > 0; bit++) {
            if (isUnSet(num1, bit)) {
                setBit(x, bit);
                reqSetBitCount--;
            }
        }

        return x;
    }
};
```

## Explanation of the Solution

1. **Count Required Set Bits**: Calculate the number of set bits in `num2` using `__builtin_popcount(num2)`.

2. **Step 1: Use Set Bits in `num1`**:

   - Iterate through the bits of `num1` from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB).
   - If a bit in `num1` is set, set the corresponding bit in `x` and decrement the count of required set bits.

3. **Step 2: Fill Remaining Set Bits**:

   - If there are still required set bits, iterate through the bits of `num1` from the least significant bit (LSB) and set bits in `x` that are unset in `num1`.

4. **Return `x`**: After both steps, `x` will have the required number of set bits, and `x XOR num1` will be minimal.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- **O(32)**: The algorithm performs at most 32 iterations in both loops (for a 32-bit integer).

### Space Complexity

- **O(1)**: The algorithm uses a constant amount of additional space.

## Example Walkthrough

### Example Input

```plaintext
num1 = 3, num2 = 5
```

### Steps

1. `num2` has `2` set bits (`0101`).
2. Start from MSB of `num1` (`0011`):
   - Use the 1st set bit (bit 1).
   - Use the 2nd set bit (bit 0).
3. No more required set bits. `x = 0011` (`3`).

### Example Output

```plaintext
3
```
