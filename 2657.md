# Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays

## Problem Statement

You are given two 0-indexed integer permutations `A` and `B` of length `n`.

A **prefix common array** of `A` and `B` is an array `C` such that `C[i]` is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the index `i` in both `A` and `B`.

Return the prefix common array of `A` and `B`.

A sequence of `n` integers is called a **permutation** if it contains all integers from `1` to `n` exactly once.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```plaintext
A = [1,3,2,4], B = [3,1,2,4]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
[0,2,3,4]
```

**Explanation:**

- At `i = 0`: No number is common, so `C[0] = 0`.
- At `i = 1`: `1` and `3` are common in `A` and `B`, so `C[1] = 2`.
- At `i = 2`: `1`, `2`, and `3` are common in `A` and `B`, so `C[2] = 3`.
- At `i = 3`: `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` are common in `A` and `B`, so `C[3] = 4`.

### Example 2

**Input:**

```plaintext
A = [2,3,1], B = [3,1,2]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
[0,1,3]
```

**Explanation:**

- At `i = 0`: No number is common, so `C[0] = 0`.
- At `i = 1`: Only `3` is common in `A` and `B`, so `C[1] = 1`.
- At `i = 2`: `1`, `2`, and `3` are common in `A` and `B`, so `C[2] = 3`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `A` and `B` are permutations of the integers from `1` to `n`.

---

## Approach

### Algorithm

1. Use a frequency array `freq` of size `n + 1` to track the occurrence of elements in both `A` and `B`.
2. Iterate over the indices of `A` and `B` simultaneously:
   - Increment the frequency of `A[i]`.
   - If the frequency of `A[i]` becomes `2`, it means `A[i]` is common in both `A` and `B`. Increment the common count.
   - Similarly, increment the frequency of `B[i]` and check if it becomes `2`.
   - Update the result array `res[i]` with the current count of common elements.
3. Return the result array.

## Implementation

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findThePrefixCommonArray(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
        int n = A.size();
        vector<int> freq(n + 1, 0); // Frequency array to track occurrences of elements
        vector<int> res(n, 0);      // Result array to store prefix common counts
        int commonCount = 0;        // Count of common elements

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Increment frequency for A[i]
            freq[A[i]]++;
            if (freq[A[i]] == 2) {
                commonCount++; // Increment common count if A[i] is now common
            }

            // Increment frequency for B[i]
            freq[B[i]]++;
            if (freq[B[i]] == 2) {
                commonCount++; // Increment common count if B[i] is now common
            }

            // Update result with the current count of common elements
            res[i] = commonCount;
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- **O(n):** We iterate through the arrays `A` and `B` once, and each operation (frequency update) is \(O(1)\).

### Space Complexity

- **O(n):** We use an additional array `freq` of size `n + 1` to track frequencies.

## Example Walkthrough

### Input

```plaintext
A = [1,3,2,4], B = [3,1,2,4]
```

### Execution

- Initialize:
  - `freq = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - `res = [0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - `commonCount = 0`

| `i` | `A[i]` | `B[i]` | `freq`            | `commonCount` | `res[i]` |
| --- | ------ | ------ | ----------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| 0   | 1      | 3      | `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]` | 0             | 0        |
| 1   | 3      | 1      | `[0, 2, 0, 2, 0]` | 2             | 2        |
| 2   | 2      | 2      | `[0, 2, 2, 2, 0]` | 3             | 3        |
| 3   | 4      | 4      | `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2]` | 4             | 4        |

### Output

```plaintext
[0, 2, 3, 4]
```
