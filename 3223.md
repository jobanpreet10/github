# Minimum Length of String After Operations

## Problem Description

You are given a string `s`. The task is to perform the following operation any number of times to minimize the length of the string:

- Choose an index `i` in the string such that there is at least one character to the left of index `i` that is equal to `s[i]`, and at least one character to the right that is also equal to `s[i]`.
- Remove the closest character to the left of index `i` that is equal to `s[i]`.
- Remove the closest character to the right of index `i` that is equal to `s[i]`.

Return the minimum length of the final string `s` that can be achieved.

### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Example

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```
s = "abaacbcbb"
```

**Output:**

```
5
```

**Explanation:**

- Choose index 2, then remove the characters at indices 0 and 3. The resulting string is `s = "bacbcbb"`.
- Choose index 3, then remove the characters at indices 0 and 5. The resulting string is `s = "acbcb"`.

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```
s = "aa"
```

**Output:**

```
2
```

**Explanation:**
We cannot perform any operations, so we return the length of the original string.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach

The goal is to determine the minimum length of the string after all valid operations. The provided solution involves counting the frequency of characters in the string and calculating the effective length based on their frequencies.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` since we iterate through the string to calculate frequencies.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as we use a fixed-size array for frequency counts.

## Implementation

Below is the implementation of the solution:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLength(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        if (n < 3) return n;

        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        for (char ch : s) {
            freq[ch - 'a']++;
        }

        int length = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (freq[i] != 0) {
                if (freq[i] % 2 == 0) {
                    length += 2;
                } else {
                    length += 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return length;
    }
};
```

## Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization:**
   Calculate the frequency of each character in the string using a `vector` of size 26.

2. **Frequency Analysis:**

   - For each character with a non-zero frequency:
     - If the frequency is even, add `2` to the final length.
     - If the frequency is odd, add `1` to the final length.

3. **Return Length:**
   Return the computed minimum length of the string after operations.

## Edge Cases

- Strings with no valid operations (`"aa"` or `"abcd"`).
- Strings where all characters are identical (`"aaaa"`).
- Strings with alternating characters that prevent full elimination (`"ababab"`).

## How to Use

1. Include the provided solution in your codebase.
2. Call `minimumLength(s)` with your string input.
3. The function will return the minimized length of the string after performing all valid operations.
