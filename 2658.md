# Maximum Number of Fish in a Grid

## Problem Description

You are given a 0-indexed 2D matrix `grid` of size `m x n`, where each cell `(r, c)` represents:

- A land cell if `grid[r][c] = 0`, or
- A water cell containing `grid[r][c]` fish, if `grid[r][c] > 0`.

A fisher can start at any water cell `(r, c)` and can perform the following operations any number of times:

1. Catch all the fish at cell `(r, c)`, or
2. Move to any adjacent water cell.

The goal is to determine the maximum number of fish the fisher can catch if he chooses his starting cell optimally. If no water cell exists, the fisher cannot catch any fish, and the result should be `0`.

An adjacent cell of `(r, c)` is one of the cells `(r, c + 1)`, `(r, c - 1)`, `(r + 1, c)`, or `(r - 1, c)` if it exists.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```python
Input: grid = [[0,2,1,0],[4,0,0,3],[1,0,0,4],[0,3,2,0]]
Output: 7
Explanation: The fisher can start at cell (1,3) and collect 3 fish, then move to cell (2,3) and collect 4 fish.
```

**Example 2:**

```python
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The fisher can start at cells (0,0) or (3,3) and collect a single fish.
```

## Solution Approach

The problem can be solved using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to explore all possible paths the fisher can take to collect fish. The steps are as follows:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Create a `visited` matrix to keep track of the cells that have already been processed.
   - Initialize a variable `fishes` to store the maximum number of fish that can be collected.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - Iterate through each cell in the grid.
   - If the cell is a water cell (`grid[i][j] > 0`) and has not been visited, start a DFS from that cell.
   - During the DFS, accumulate the number of fish in the current connected component of water cells.
   - Update the `fishes` variable with the maximum value found.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After processing all cells, return the value stored in `fishes`.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int drow[4] = { -1, 0, 1, 0 };
    int dcol[4] = { 0, -1, 0, 1 };

    void dfs(int row, int col, vector<vector<int>>& visited, vector<vector<int>>& grid, int& maxi) {
        maxi += grid[row][col];
        visited[row][col] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int nrow = row + drow[i];
            int ncol = col + dcol[i];

            if (nrow >= 0 && nrow < grid.size() && ncol >= 0 && ncol < grid[0].size() &&
                grid[nrow][ncol] > 0 && !visited[nrow][ncol]) {
                dfs(nrow, ncol, visited, grid, maxi);
            }
        }
    }

    int findMaxFish(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int fishes = 0;
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> visited(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] > 0 && !visited[i][j]) {
                    int maxi = 0;
                    dfs(i, j, visited, grid, maxi);
                    fishes = max(maxi, fishes);
                }
            }
        }
        return fishes;
    }
};
```

## How to Use

1. **Input**: Provide a 2D matrix `grid` where each cell represents either land (`0`) or water (`> 0`).
2. **Output**: The function `findMaxFish` will return the maximum number of fish that can be collected by the fisher.

### Example Usage

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> grid = {
    {0, 2, 1, 0},
    {4, 0, 0, 3},
    {1, 0, 0, 4},
    {0, 3, 2, 0}
};

Solution solution;
int result = solution.findMaxFish(grid);
cout << "Maximum number of fish: " << result << endl;  // Output: 7
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. Each cell is visited at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n), due to the `visited` matrix and the recursion stack used in DFS.

## Conclusion

This solution efficiently finds the maximum number of fish that can be collected by exploring all possible paths using DFS. The use of a `visited` matrix ensures that each cell is processed only once, making the algorithm both optimal and easy to understand.
