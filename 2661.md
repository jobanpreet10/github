# First Completely Painted Row or Column

## Problem Description
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `arr` and an `m x n` integer matrix `mat`. Both `arr` and `mat` contain all the integers in the range `[1, m * n]`.

Go through each index `i` in `arr` starting from index `0` and paint the cell in `mat` containing the integer `arr[i]`.

Return the smallest index `i` at which either a row or a column will be completely painted in `mat`.

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```plaintext
arr = [1, 3, 4, 2]
mat = [[1, 4],
       [2, 3]]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
2
```
**Explanation:**
The moves are shown in order, and both the first row and second column of the matrix become fully painted at `arr[2]`.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```plaintext
arr = [2, 8, 7, 4, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9]
mat = [[3, 2, 5],
       [1, 4, 6],
       [8, 7, 9]]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
3
```
**Explanation:**
The second column becomes fully painted at `arr[3]`.

## Constraints
- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `arr.length == m * n`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= m * n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= arr[i], mat[r][c] <= m * n`
- All integers in `arr` are unique.
- All integers in `mat` are unique.

## Approach

### Algorithm
1. Create a hash map to store the index of each value in `arr` for quick lookup.
2. Initialize `minIndex` to `INT_MAX` to track the earliest index when a row or column is completely painted.
3. For each row in the matrix:
   - Determine the maximum index needed to paint the row completely.
   - Update `minIndex` with the minimum value between `minIndex` and the maximum index for this row.
4. For each column in the matrix:
   - Determine the maximum index needed to paint the column completely.
   - Update `minIndex` with the minimum value between `minIndex` and the maximum index for this column.
5. Return `minIndex` as the result.

### Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int firstCompleteIndex(vector<int>& arr, vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int m = mat.size();
        int n = mat[0].size();
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            int val = arr[i];
            mp[val] = i;
        }

        int minIndex = INT_MAX;

        // Check for rows
        for (int row = 0; row < m; row++) {
            int maxIndexToFill = INT_MIN;

            for (int col = 0; col < n; col++) {
                int val = mat[row][col];
                int idx = mp[val];
                maxIndexToFill = max(idx, maxIndexToFill);
            }

            minIndex = min(minIndex, maxIndexToFill);
        }

        // Check for columns
        for (int col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            int maxIndexToFill = INT_MIN;

            for (int row = 0; row < m; row++) {
                int val = mat[row][col];
                int idx = mp[val];
                maxIndexToFill = max(idx, maxIndexToFill);
            }

            minIndex = min(minIndex, maxIndexToFill);
        }

        return minIndex;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- Building the hash map: `O(m * n)`
- Checking all rows: `O(m * n)`
- Checking all columns: `O(m * n)`
- **Total:** `O(m * n)`

### Space Complexity
- Hash map storage: `O(m * n)`

## Key Points
- The solution uses a hash map for fast lookup of values.
- Both rows and columns are checked independently to find the earliest index where either is completely painted.
- The algorithm is optimized to handle the maximum constraints efficiently.
