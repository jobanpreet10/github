# Maximum Score After Splitting a String

## Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s` consisting of zeros ('0') and ones ('1'), the task is to split the string into two non-empty substrings such that the **score** is maximized. The score is defined as:

- The number of zeros in the left substring.
- The number of ones in the right substring.

The function should return the maximum score obtainable by splitting the string.

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
s = "011101"
```

**Output:**

```
5
```

**Explanation:**
Possible ways of splitting and their scores are:

- "0" | "11101" => Score = 1 (zeros in left) + 4 (ones in right) = 5
- "01" | "1101" => Score = 1 + 3 = 4
- "011" | "101" => Score = 1 + 2 = 3
- "0111" | "01" => Score = 1 + 1 = 2
- "01110" | "1" => Score = 2 + 1 = 3

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
s = "00111"
```

**Output:**

```
5
```

**Explanation:**
Best split: "00" | "111" => Score = 2 + 3 = 5

### Example 3

**Input:**

```
s = "1111"
```

**Output:**

```
3
```

**Explanation:**
Best split: "111" | "1" => Score = 0 + 3 = 3

## Constraints

- 2 <= s.length <= 500
- The string `s` consists of characters '0' and '1' only.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach

To maximize the score, the problem can be solved efficiently using a single traversal of the string. The idea is to keep track of:

1. **Zeros Count:** The cumulative count of zeros in the left substring as we iterate through the string.
2. **Ones Count:** The cumulative count of ones in the right substring (this is calculated as the total count of ones minus the ones seen so far).
3. **Best Score:** The maximum score encountered while iterating.

### Steps

1. Count the total number of ones (`totalOnes`) in the string.
2. Initialize counters:
   - `zerosCount` to track zeros encountered in the left substring.
   - `onesCount` to track the remaining ones in the right substring.
   - `bestScore` to store the maximum score.
3. Traverse the string from the start to the second-last character:
   - Increment `zerosCount` if the current character is '0'.
   - Decrement `totalOnes` if the current character is '1' (this becomes the ones in the right substring).
   - Calculate the score for the current split as `zerosCount + totalOnes`.
   - Update `bestScore` if the current score is higher.
4. Return `bestScore`.

## Implementation

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxScore(string s) {
        int totalOnes = 0;
        for (char ch : s) {
            if (ch == '1') {
                totalOnes++;
            }
        }

        int zerosCount = 0;
        int bestScore = INT_MIN;

        // Traverse up to the second-last character
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (s[i] == '0') {
                zerosCount++;
            } else {
                totalOnes--;
            }

            // Calculate score for the current split
            bestScore = max(bestScore, zerosCount + totalOnes);
        }

        return bestScore;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Initialization:**

   - `totalOnes` counts all the '1's in the string to facilitate computation of the right substring score dynamically.
   - `zerosCount` starts at 0, as no zeros are considered initially.
   - `bestScore` is initialized to a very small value (`INT_MIN`) to ensure any calculated score replaces it.

2. **Traversal:**

   - For each character in the string up to the second-last:
     - Increment `zerosCount` if the character is '0'.
     - Decrement `totalOnes` if the character is '1'.
     - Calculate the current score as `zerosCount + totalOnes`.
     - Update `bestScore` if the current score exceeds the previously recorded best score.

3. **Return Value:**
   - After the loop, `bestScore` holds the maximum score achievable by splitting the string.

## Complexity Analysis

1. **Time Complexity:**

   - The algorithm runs in O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. This is because the string is traversed only once.

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - O(1), as only a few integer variables are used for calculations.

---

## Edge Cases

1. **Minimum Length String (`s = "01"`):**

   - Left = "0", Right = "1" => Score = 1 + 1 = 2.

2. **All Zeros (`s = "0000"`):**

   - Best split occurs just before the last character.

3. **All Ones (`s = "1111"`):**
   - Best split occurs just before the last character.

## Example Walkthrough

### Input:

```
s = "011101"
```

**Execution:**

- Total ones: 4.
- Iteration:
  - i = 0: `zerosCount = 1`, `totalOnes = 4`, `score = 1 + 4 = 5`.
  - i = 1: `zerosCount = 1`, `totalOnes = 3`, `score = 1 + 3 = 4`.
  - i = 2: `zerosCount = 1`, `totalOnes = 2`, `score = 1 + 2 = 3`.
  - i = 3: `zerosCount = 1`, `totalOnes = 1`, `score = 1 + 1 = 2`.
  - i = 4: `zerosCount = 2`, `totalOnes = 1`, `score = 2 + 1 = 3`.

**Output:**

```
5
```
