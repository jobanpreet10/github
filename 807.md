# Eventual Safe States - Solution Explanation

This document explains the implementation of a solution to LeetCode Problem [802. Find Eventual Safe States](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states/).

## Problem Statement

A directed graph of `n` nodes is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array `graph`. Here, `graph[i]` is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node `i`, meaning there is a directed edge from node `i` to each node in `graph[i]`.

- A node is a **terminal node** if there are no outgoing edges.
- A node is a **safe node** if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).

### Objective

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph in ascending order.

## Example

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```plaintext
graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
[2,4,5,6]
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```plaintext
graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
[4]
```

## Constraints

- `n == graph.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= graph[i].length <= n`
- `0 <= graph[i][j] <= n - 1`
- `graph[i]` is sorted in strictly increasing order.
- The graph may contain self-loops.
- The number of edges in the graph is in the range `[1, 4 * 10^4]`.

## Solution Approach

### Key Idea:

Instead of analyzing the graph in its given form, the solution processes the **reversed graph** (a graph where the directions of all edges are reversed). This transformation simplifies the task of finding safe nodes since terminal nodes in the original graph become sources in the reversed graph.

### Steps:

1. **Reverse the Graph**:
   - Create an adjacency list of the reversed graph.
   - Compute the in-degrees of each node in the reversed graph.

2. **Topological Sorting Using a Queue**:
   - Push all nodes with an in-degree of `0` (these are terminal nodes in the original graph) into the queue.
   - Perform a BFS-style traversal:
     - Remove a node from the queue and add it to the list of safe states.
     - For each adjacent node, reduce its in-degree.
     - If the in-degree of an adjacent node becomes `0`, push it into the queue.

3. **Sort and Return the Result**:
   - Safe nodes are collected during the traversal.
   - The list of safe nodes is sorted in ascending order before returning.

### Time Complexity:

- **Graph Reversal:** `O(E)`, where `E` is the number of edges.
- **BFS Traversal:** `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of nodes.
- **Sorting the Result:** `O(V log V)`.

Overall: `O(V + E + V log V)`.

### Space Complexity:

- Adjacency list for reversed graph: `O(V + E)`.
- In-degree array and queue: `O(V)`.

## Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> eventualSafeNodes(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int n = graph.size();
        vector<vector<int>> adjList(n);
        vector<int> Indegree(n);

        // Reverse the graph and calculate in-degrees
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (auto it : graph[i]) {
                Indegree[i]++;
                adjList[it].push_back(i);
            }
        }

        // Push all terminal nodes (in-degree = 0) into the queue
        queue<int> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (Indegree[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
            }
        }

        // Perform topological sorting
        vector<int> safeStates;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            safeStates.push_back(node);

            for (auto it : adjList[node]) {
                Indegree[it]--;
                if (Indegree[it] == 0) {
                    q.push(it);
                }
            }
        }

        // Sort the result in ascending order
        sort(safeStates.begin(), safeStates.end());
        return safeStates;
    }
};
```

## Example Walkthrough

### Input:
```plaintext
graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
```

### Reversed Graph and In-Degrees:

- **Reversed Graph Adjacency List:**
  ```plaintext
  0 -> 3
  1 -> 0
  2 -> 0, 1
  3 -> 1, 2
  4 -> 5
  5 -> 2, 4
  6 ->
  ```

- **In-Degrees:**
  ```plaintext
  Indegree = [2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
  ```

### Topological Sorting:

1. **Initial Queue:** `[5, 6]` (nodes with `Indegree = 0`).
2. **Traversal:**
   - Process `5`: Reduce in-degrees of `2` and `4`.
   - Process `6`: No adjacent nodes.
   - Continue until the queue is empty.

### Final Safe States:
```plaintext
[2, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Output:
```plaintext
[2, 4, 5, 6]
```
