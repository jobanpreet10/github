# Highest Peak Problem - Solution Explanation

## Problem Statement
You are given an integer matrix `isWater` of size `m x n` that represents a map of land and water cells:

- If `isWater[i][j] == 0`, cell `(i, j)` is a land cell.
- If `isWater[i][j] == 1`, cell `(i, j)` is a water cell.

You must assign each cell a height such that:
1. The height of each cell is non-negative.
2. Water cells have a height of 0.
3. The absolute height difference between two adjacent cells is at most 1.

Your task is to find an assignment of heights that maximizes the maximum height in the matrix and return the resulting matrix.

## Solution Overview
This solution uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to propagate the height values starting from the water cells (`isWater[i][j] == 1`) and assigning heights to adjacent cells incrementally.

### Key Steps in the Solution:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a `height` matrix of size `m x n` initialized with `-1` to indicate unvisited cells.
   - Initialize a queue `q` and enqueue all water cells `(i, j)` with their height set to `0`.

2. **BFS Traversal:**
   - Use a queue to explore cells level by level.
   - For each cell, calculate the height of its unvisited neighbors as `height[current] + 1` and enqueue them.

3. **Direction Array:**
   - Use arrays `drow` and `dcol` to simplify neighbor traversal (north, south, east, west).

4. **Termination:**
   - BFS ensures that all cells are visited, and the height values are calculated optimally with minimal height differences between neighbors.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> highestPeak(vector<vector<int>>& isWater) {
        int m = isWater.size();
        int n = isWater[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>>height(m,vector<int>(n,-1));
        queue<pair<int,int>>q;

        // Initialize water cells in the queue with height 0
        for(int i = 0 ; i< m ; i++){
            for(int j =0 ; j< n; j++){
                if(isWater[i][j] ==  1){
                    q.push({i,j});
                    height[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }

        // Direction vectors for neighbor traversal
        int drow[4] = {-1,0,1,0};
        int dcol[4] = {0,-1,0,1};

        // BFS traversal
        while(!q.empty()){
            auto p = q.front();
            q.pop();
            int row = p.first;
            int col = p.second;
            
            for(int  i =0 ; i < 4; i++){
                int nrow = row + drow[i];
                int ncol = col + dcol[i];
                if(nrow >=0 && nrow < m && ncol >= 0 && ncol < n && height[nrow][ncol] == -1 ){
                    height[nrow][ncol] = height[row][col] + 1;
                    q.push({nrow,ncol});
                }
            }
        }
        return height;
    }
};
```

## Example Walkthrough

### Input:
```plaintext
isWater = [
  [0, 1],
  [0, 0]
]
```

### Steps:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `height = [[-1, 0], [-1, -1]]`
   - `queue = [(0, 1)]`

2. **BFS Iteration 1:**
   - Process `(0, 1)`:
     - Update `(0, 0)` to `1` and enqueue.
     - Update `(1, 1)` to `1` and enqueue.

3. **BFS Iteration 2:**
   - Process `(0, 0)`:
     - Update `(1, 0)` to `2` and enqueue.

4. **BFS Iteration 3:**
   - Process `(1, 1)`.

5. **Final Matrix:**
   ```plaintext
   height = [
     [1, 0],
     [2, 1]
   ]
   ```

## Complexity Analysis

1. **Time Complexity:**
   - BFS processes each cell once: **O(m × n)**.

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - Queue size and `height` matrix storage: **O(m × n)**.

---

## Constraints
- `1 <= m, n <= 1000`
- `isWater[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
- At least one water cell exists.

---

## Notes
- The BFS guarantees the shortest path to the nearest water cell.
- Multiple solutions may exist, but all valid solutions will have the same maximum height.
