# Redundant Connection (LeetCode 684)

## Problem Statement
A tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles. You are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, with **one additional edge added**. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from `1` to `n` and was not an edge that already existed.

The graph is represented as an array `edges` of length `n` where `edges[i] = [a, b]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a` and `b` in the graph.

Your task is to **return an edge that can be removed** so that the resulting graph is a tree with `n` nodes. If there are multiple valid answers, return the one that occurs **last** in the input.

### Example 1:
#### Input:
```cpp
edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
```
#### Output:
```cpp
[2,3]
```

### Example 2:
#### Input:
```cpp
edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
```
#### Output:
```cpp
[1,4]
```

## Solution Approach
We can solve this problem using **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** (also known as **Union-Find**). The key idea is to detect the first cycle in the graph and return the edge that forms it.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a **DSU (Disjoint Set Union) structure** to manage connected components.
2. Iterate through the given edges and use the **find** operation to check if the two nodes already belong to the same connected component.
3. If the two nodes are already connected, return the current edge as it forms a cycle.
4. Otherwise, merge the components using the **union** operation.

## Code Implementation
```cpp
class DSU{
public:
    vector<int> parent;
    vector<int> rank;

    DSU(int n) {
        parent.resize(n+1);
        rank.resize(n+1);
        for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
            rank[i] = 0;
        }
    }

    int find(int x) {
        if (x == parent[x]) return x;
        return parent[x] = find(parent[x]); // Path compression
    }

    void Union(int x, int y) {
        int x_parent = find(x);
        int y_parent = find(y);

        if (x_parent == y_parent) return; // Already in the same set

        if (rank[x_parent] > rank[y_parent]) {
            parent[y_parent] = x_parent;
        } else if (rank[x_parent] < rank[y_parent]) {
            parent[x_parent] = y_parent;
        } else {
            parent[y_parent] = x_parent;
            rank[x_parent]++;
        }
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = edges.size();
        DSU dsu(n);
        
        for (auto &edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            
            if (dsu.find(u) == dsu.find(v)) {
                return edge; // Cycle detected
            }
            dsu.Union(u, v);
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Find Operation (Path Compression)**: `O(α(N))` (Inverse Ackermann function, nearly constant time)
- **Union Operation (Union by Rank)**: `O(α(N))`
- **Overall Complexity**: `O(N * α(N)) ≈ O(N)`

## Explanation of the Code
- **DSU Class:**
  - `find(x)`: Uses **path compression** to speed up finding the parent of a node.
  - `Union(x, y)`: Uses **union by rank** to merge two sets efficiently.

- **Solution Class:**
  - Iterates through edges and checks if the two nodes belong to the same component using `find()`.
  - If they do, that edge is redundant and is returned.
  - Otherwise, `Union()` is performed to merge the sets.

## Edge Cases Considered
✅ Smallest input case (`n = 3`)
✅ Already a tree (should return the last edge forming a cycle)
✅ Large inputs (`n = 1000`)
✅ Graph with nodes forming a cycle at the end

## Alternative Approaches
1. **DFS Cycle Detection**: Instead of DSU, use **DFS** to detect cycles, but DSU is more efficient.
2. **BFS Approach**: Can also be used but requires maintaining visited nodes explicitly.

## Conclusion
The **Union-Find (DSU)** approach efficiently detects the redundant connection with nearly constant time complexity. It is optimal for handling **dynamic connectivity problems** like cycle detection in graphs.
